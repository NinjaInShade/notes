# Dev ideas

Welcome to my personal project ideas <br />
Started on 26/01/2023, these are ideas for future projects. Some ideas were taken/inspired from these sources:

- https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas
- https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x

## **Ninja (fullstack library)**

- `[Svelte]:` widget library
- `[TS]:` util library
- `[Postgres]:` sql library
- `[TS/Vite]:` build library
- `[TS]:` core client/server library

## **Sixth sense (issue/feature tracker)**

- Graphic on portfolio showcasing this could be solid colour bg, footsteps (like sixth sense in COD), leading up to a bug
- Include a "sign in as guest" for demos, use a different DB for this and reset data every 24 hours

## **RFID locked box (random project)**

- Simple wooden box with a lock
- Unlocked via a RFID key card
- Backend with node/ts

## **BitTorrent client (random project)**
